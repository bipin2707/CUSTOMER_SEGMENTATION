# CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
In this project, I will try to figure out who the best customers are.
 I will look at the data in the following ways to answer that question:

 Explore the general distribution of the data to get a sense of Male vs. Female customers, and how their income, age, and spending scores are similar or different.
 Explore which gender has a higher income.
 Explore which gender has a higher average spending score.
